#+STARTUP: showall

* Tasks (analysis) 
** DONE Write up reaction time results in LaTeX
** DONE Write up choice results in LaTeX
** DONE Does task, attention or value predict number of fixations?
** DONE Does task, attention or value predict the length of fixations?
** DONE Compare models with attention measured using different numerators
** DONE Look to see whether order effect in number of fixations
** DONE Look to see whether order effect in length of fixations
** DONE Rerun rt models with all different types of attention
** DONE Add analyses without removing rt trials
** DONE Does overall value predict RT in binary choice but not evaluation task?
** TODO emmeans - levels for delta_A, delta_V, task (draw model predictions)
** TODO Last gaze predicts choice?
** TODO Gaze cascade effect?

* Files
+ [[~/NS01/analysis/NS01analysis.R][Analysis file]] :: Most up-to-date analysis

- Total overall value predicts RT in binary choice but not evaulation task.
