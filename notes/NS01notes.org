#+STARTUP: showall

* Tasks (analysis) 
** DONE Write up reaction time results in LaTeX
** DONE Write up choice results in LaTeX
** DONE Does task, attention or value predict number of fixations?
** DONE Does task, attention or value predict the length of fixations?
** DONE Compare models with attention measured using different numerators
** DONE Look to see whether order effect in number of fixations
** DONE Look to see whether order effect in length of fixations
** DONE Rerun rt models with all different types of attention
** DONE Add analyses without removing rt trials
** DONE Does overall value predict RT in binary choice but not evaluation task?
** TODO emmeans - levels for delta_A, delta_V, task (draw model predictions)
** TODO Check you did random variables correct for predict
** TODO Graphs of choice - predict if logistic, type=response
** TODO Sort N in tables
** DONE Look at difference between block 1 and block 2 in terms of choice model (Table 2)
** DONE Two graphs of continuous scale usage for blocks 1 and 2
** TODO Make slides
** TODO Last gaze predicts choice?
** TODO Gaze cascade effect?
