#+STARTUP: showall

* Tasks (analysis) 
** DONE Write up reaction time results in LaTeX
** DONE Write up choice results in LaTeX
** DONE Does task, attention or value predict number of fixations?
** DONE Does task, attention or value predict the length of fixations?
** DONE Compare models with attention measured using different numerators
** DONE Look to see whether order effect in number of fixations
** DONE Look to see whether order effect in length of fixations
** DONE Rerun rt models with all different types of attention
** DONE Add analyses without removing rt trials
** DONE Remove jitter on prediction graphs
** DONE Log-odds graph, with choice probabilities on the labelled scale (y-axis)
** DONE RT models by block
** TODO Make choice graphs with hypothetical interactions (i.e. lower CI and upper CI)
** DONE Histogram of continuous responses by person (facet_grid)
** TODO Last gaze predicts choice?
** TODO Gaze cascade effect?

* Slides
** DONE Describe experiment
** DONE Get /why/ from Tim/Neil
** 

* Files
+ [[~/NS01/analysis/NS01analysis.R][Analysis file]] :: Most up-to-date analysis
+ [[~/NS01/techReport/NS01techReport.tex][Tech report]] :: Write up of rationale, method and results (so far).
