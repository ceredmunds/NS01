  abstract = {Most organisms facing a choice between multiple stimuli will look repeatedly at them, presumably implementing a comparisonprocess between the itemsâ€™ values. Little is known about the nature of the comparison process in value-based decision-makingor about the role of visual fixations in this process. We created a computational model of value-based binary choice in whichfixations guide the comparison process and tested it on humans using eye-tracking. We found that the model can quantitativelyexplain complex relationships between fixation patterns and choices, as well as several fixation-driven decision biases.},

  abstract = {When making decisions, people tend to choose the option they have looked at more. An unanswered question is howattention influences the choice process: whether it amplifies the subjective value of the looked-at option or insteadadds a constant, value-independent bias. To address this, we examined choice data from six eye-tracking studies (Ns =39, 44, 44, 36, 20, and 45, respectively) to characterize the interaction between value and gaze in the choice process.We found that the summed values of the options influenced response times in every data set and the gaze-choicecorrelation in most data sets, in line with an amplifying role of attention in the choice process. Our results suggest thatthis amplifying effect is more pronounced in tasks using large sets of familiar stimuli, compared with tasks using smallsets of learned stimuli.},

  abstract = {When making decisions, people tend to look back and forth between the alternativesuntil they eventually make a choice. Eye-tracking research has established that theseshifts in attention are strongly linked to choice outcomes. A predominant frameworkfor understanding the dynamics of the choice process, and thus the effects of attention,is sequential sampling of information. However, existing methods for estimatingthe attention parameters in these models are computationally costly and overlyflexible, and yield estimates with unknown precision and bias. Here we propose anestimation method that relies on a link between sequential sampling models andrandom utility models (RUM). This method uses familiar econometric tools (i.e.,logistic regression) and yields estimates that appear to be unbiased and relativelyprecise compared to existing methods, in a small fraction of the computation time.The RUM thus appears to be a useful tool for estimating the effects of attention onchoice.},
