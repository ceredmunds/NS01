\section{Experiment 1} \label{exp:NS01} 
\subsection{Method}
\subsubsection{Participants}
We had a lot of people in this study.

\subsubsection{Materials}
Several materials were used for this project.  Some of themwere
already created for prior research.

\subsubsection{Design}
This section describes the study's design.

\subsubsection{Procedure}
The procedure was fairly straightforward, yet required
attention to detail.

\subsubsection{Data analysis}
\nameref{exp:NS01} was pre-registered at \url{https://aspredicted.org/19698}.
% Need to make public 

\subsection{Results}
Table \ref{tab:ComplexTable} contains some sample data.  Our
statistical prowess in analyzing these data is unmatched.


\section{Experiment 2} \label{exp:NS07}
\subsubsection{Participants}
We had a lot of people in this study.

\subsubsection{Materials}
Several materials were used for this project.  Some of them were
already created for prior research.

\subsubsection{Design}
This section describes the study's design.

\subsubsection{Procedure}
The procedure was fairly straightforward, yet required
attention to detail.

\subsubsection{Data analysis}
\nameref{exp:NS07} was pre-registered at \url{}.
% Need to make and make public

\subsection{Results}
Table \ref{tab:ComplexTable} contains some sample data.  Our
statistical prowess in analyzing these data is unmatched.


\section{Discussion}
This is a lengthy and erudite discussion.  It demonstrates amazing
skill in interpreting the results for the masses.

\section{Open Science Declaration}
Both experiments were preregistered (see above). In addition, the data and analyses files are available by the Open Science Framework at \url{}.
