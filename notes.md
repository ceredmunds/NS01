# Leading experiment idea
## Overall design
Basically, this is a 2 (task: decision, evaluation) x 2 (no. options: one, two) design. However, we (Charlotte, Tim, Devdeepta) think it should be run as a series of 2 condition experiment. Starting with Cell 3 vs. Cell 4, because Tim thinks that's the most likely source of the discrepancy.

Note: below the cells are interchangeably discussed in terms of prices and preferences. Mainly, because I (Charlotte) couldn't think of how to turn Cell 1 into a preference judgement.

### Cell 1: Single choice
This is modelled on the paper by Krajbich, Lu, Camerer & Rangel (2012). The participant judges whether they would buy the displayed item at that price.

### Cell 2: Single evaluation
The participants states how much they would pay for the displayed item.

### Cell 3: Binary choice
The participant choses which of two options they prefer.

### Cell 4: Binary evaluation
The participant states how much they would prefer Option 1 over Option 2 using a Likert scale.

## Summary of experimental protocol: Binary options with choice vs preference difference ratings
- Within-subjects, counterbalanced
- Initial value rating phase
- Both blocks need to be chosen using mouse, either
    1. Choice: left vs. right
    2. Preference: rating scale
### Aim:
Looking to see whether it's choice vs. evaluation that results in a value*attention interaction.


# Future possible experiments
## Binary choice vs. binary choice with one fixed option
- Within-subjects, counterbalanced
- Initial value rating phase
- Pick "middle" item for fixed option
- Two blocks counterbalanced:
    1. Normal binary choice
    2. Binary choice with one item always fixed
### Aim:
Looking to see whether one vs. two options is a source of value*attention interaction.
### Issues:
Practice effects: would participants look at the fixed option when making their decisions throughout the experiment?

## Single rating vs. binary rating(s?) w/ attractive background distractor
- Top stimulus/stimuli, bottom attractive pictures (change throughout exp.)
### Aim:
Alternative way of testing one vs. two options

## Binary choice w/ single option or baskets
### Aim:
Test to see whether baskets work as a way to look at one vs. multiple options.

## Holistic vs. distinct dimensions stimuli
- In faces, posters and scenes the information in integral
- In houses and health exps, each dimension is separated
- Compare movie posters with movies listed as attributes
