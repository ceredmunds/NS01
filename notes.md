# Future experiment ideas:

## Binary choice vs. binary choice with one fixed option
- Within-subjects, counterbalanced
- Initial value rating phase
- Pick "middle" item for fixed option
- Two blocks counterbalanced:
    1. Normal binary choice
    2. Binary choice with one item always fixed
### Aim:
Looking to see whether one vs. two options is a source of value*attention interaction.

## Binary options with choice vs preference difference ratings
- Within-subjects, counterbalanced
- Initial value rating phase (seems sensible--necessary?)
- Both blocks need to be chosen using mouse, either
    1. Choice: left vs. right
    2. Preference: rating scale
### Aim:
Looking to see whether it's choice vs. evaluation that results in a value*attention interaction.

## Single rating vs. binary rating(s?) w/ attractive background distractor
- Top stimulus/stimuli, bottom attractive pictures (change throughout exp.)
### Aim:
Alternative way of testing one vs. two options

## Binary choice w/ single option or baskets
### Aim:
Test to see whether baskets work as a way to look at one vs. multiple options.
